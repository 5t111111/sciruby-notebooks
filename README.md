# SciRuby example notebooks

This repository will in the future include a bunch of notebooks showing the
functionality of iruby and scientific ruby gems.

Furthermore there will be a Dockerfile which allows the creation of a Docker
container with everything preinstalled what is needed.

A lot of Python examples can be found at [the IPython
Gallery](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks).
