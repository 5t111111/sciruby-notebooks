# SciRuby example notebooks

This repository includes a bunch of notebooks showing the functionality of iruby and scientific ruby gems.

Furthermore there is a Dockerfile which allows the creation of a Docker container with everything preinstalled what is needed.
A prebuild container is available at [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/minad/sciruby-notebooks/).

A lot of Python examples can be found at [the IPython Gallery](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks).
